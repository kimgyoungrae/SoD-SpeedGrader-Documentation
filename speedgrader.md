## Introduction
SpeedGrader is a electronic grading tool from Canvas that had been adopted by the University of Washington School of Dentistry to facilitate digital grading. Digital grading has many advantages over paper grading:
-- It enhances student access to accurate grades.
-- It allows instructors to provide more instant and higher-quality feedback not typically offered through paper grading.
-- It minimizes the chance of lost scores, forms, or doctored forms.
-- It reduces printing burdens and paper waste.
-- It allows you to view the statistics for each grader for grading calibration and consistency.

Like any other tool, SpeedGrader does have certain limitations and drawbacks:
-- It require a stable, high-speed internet connection.
-- It does not inform you if you have missed grading a criteria for a student.
-- It can override entered grades if multiple instructors grade the same student concurrently.
