## Introduction
SpeedGrader is a electronic grading tool from Canvas that had been adopted by the University of Washington School of Dentistry to facilitate digital grading. Digital grading has many advantages over paper grading:
- Enhances student access to accurate grades.
- Allows instructors to provide instant, high-quality feedback.
- Minimizes the risk of lost or doctored forms.
- Addresses unnecessary paper waste.
- Allows staff to view relevant statistics for grading calibration and consistency.

Like any other tool, SpeedGrader does have certain limitations and drawbacks:
- Requires a stable, high-speed internet connection.
- Does not inform incomplete grading for a student.
- Can override entered grades if multiple instructors grade the same student concurrently.

## Accessing SpeedGrader
Prior to attending your clinic session, have the following ready:
- Your UW NetID and corresponding password. (Note: Your UW NetID is the first part of your UW email. For example, if my email was 'johndoe@uw.edu', my UW NetID would be 'johndoe'.)
- Your mobile phone that serves as your two-factor authentication (2FA) device.

If you are unsure of your UW NetID, ask one of the course directors, program coordinators, or administrators to retrieve it for you. Alternatively, use this tool to [retrieve your UW NetID](https://identity.uw.edu/new/find). If you have forgotten your password, [refer to this page](https://identity.uw.edu/account/resetpassword/).

In order to access SpeedGrader on the iPad, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to [Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/) in the Safari web browser. Alternatively, click on the Purple UW bookmark from the homescreen dock to navigate to this page.
