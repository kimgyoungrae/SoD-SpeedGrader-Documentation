### Accessing SpeedGrader
In order to access SpeedGrader on the iPad, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to 'https://canvas.uw.edu' in the Safari web browser. Alternatively, click on the Purple UW bookmark from the homescreen dock to navigate to this page.
2. Login with your UW NetID credentials. Your UW NetID is the first part of your UW email (for example, if my email was 'johndoe@uw.edu', my UW NetID would be 'johndoe'). You may be asked to sign in with two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security. 
3. You should now see a dashboard page. Using the purple navigation bar located on the left-side of the screen, click on 'Courses'.
4. You will see a list of courses that you have been added to. Locate and click on the course that you are teaching or grading for.
5. You should now see the course homepage. Using the blue courses navigation links, locate and click on the 'Assignments' link.
- You can also try to look for the assignment under 'Modules'. However, the instructor or course support staff has to manually import the assignment over from 'Assignments'. 
6. Under 'Assignments', locate and click on the assignment that you are grading.
7. On the page of that assignment, find 'Related Items' on the right side of the screen. Underneath 'Related Items', click on 'SpeedGrader'.
